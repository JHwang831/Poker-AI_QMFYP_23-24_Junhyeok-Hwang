This project presents the development and evaluation of an artificial intelligence (AI) player designed for Texas Hold'em, a popular form of poker. The project was conceptualized to bridge the gap between traditional tabletop game strategies and modern AI technologies, aiming to create an AI that could effectively simulate human-like decision-making in a competitive card game environment. The AI player was developed as part of a comprehensive academic exercise, aligning with the broader learning objectives of a Computer Science program which includes mastering algorithms, programming, and AI applications.

The development process began with a thorough literature review, identifying key techniques and prior implementations of AI in gaming, especially poker. This review helped shape the theoretical foundation of the AI player, focusing on algorithms that are adept at handling incomplete information, a hallmark of poker games where players must make decisions based on partially hidden card distributions.

Following the literature review, the methodology was defined to include the design and implementation of the AI system using Python. The AI utilized a combination of hand-ranking algorithms and a decision-making framework based on predefined hand strengths. The system architecture was designed to be modular, facilitating easy updates and adaptations. Key components of the system included classes for representing cards, decks, and the logic for evaluating poker hands. These components were rigorously tested through unit testing to ensure their reliability and functionality.

Integration testing and playtesting with human participants were conducted to evaluate the overall system integration and the AI's performance in real-game scenarios. These tests were crucial for assessing the AI's ability to apply its theoretical knowledge in practical settings and to refine its strategies based on gameplay feedback.

The evaluation of the AI player was multi-faceted, utilizing several performance metrics to measure its effectiveness. These included win rate analysis, strategic adaptability, response time, and the accuracy of its decision-making. Results from these metrics indicated that while the AI performed well against novice and intermediate players, it struggled with more complex strategic plays like bluffing and dealing with highly aggressive tactics employed by experienced players.

Feedback from human participants provided additional insights into the AI’s gameplay impact, highlighting areas where the AI excelled and where it could be improved. Participants appreciated the AI’s competence in basic gameplay but noted that it lacked the depth required to handle high-stakes or highly strategic game situations effectively.

Based on the findings, the paper discusses potential improvements for future versions of the AI player. These include integrating advanced machine learning techniques to enhance the AI's learning capabilities, extending the AI to support multiplayer scenarios, and improving the user interface for a more engaging player experience.

This project not only contributes to academic knowledge in AI applications in gaming but also demonstrates the practical challenges and considerations involved in designing AI systems that can simulate complex human behaviors. The development of the Texas Hold'em AI player serves as a valuable case study in the application of computer science principles to real-world problems, offering insights that could inform future AI research and development in similar domains.
